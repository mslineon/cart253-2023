I have develop an interest and desire to learn more about programming. It was a rocky road, full of challenges, excitement as well as I also cried of frustration. It was well worth it in the end. I have learned to become quite independent and to look for the answers on the internet. To be honest, I am not confident and don't consider myself as a programmer since I believe it takes more than a 4 month course to become a programmer. Although, it provided with a good base and a curiosity to understand it further. In terms of challenge, I would say that everything was in a way a challenge. In no means, I would say I am good at it. 

Especially, I have trouble following tutorials. I did find them challenging to follow them step by step. I learned the most when I was trying it out, looking through the p5js library, youtube as well as asking for help whenever something was really not working. 

What I feel I am the most proud was to have an idea, and to be able to complete it and visually see it. The project 2 is definitely my favorite project to work on. Most likely because I was just able to do whatever I wanted without any restrictions to follow and any guidelines. As much as I believe the guideline/brief are there to teach us, and to provide me a good technical/tools kits to advance our skills, I really looked forward to do something that was basically just free for all. A blank page, where I was just facing myself.

As much as attention to details is key to me, I felt that I could really see what we meant by the devil is in the details in the programming world. The future holds itself with all the advancing technologies, and I try to move forward with it. I am looking into getting into the Computer science of the program, I although have low hopes for myself. In my practice for the future, I would like to trust myself more in being able to complete a project, put the idea together and to aesthetically showcasing it, using programming. Eventually, I would like to learn on more visual programming languages, so this is also a note for my future self. 

Thank you,
