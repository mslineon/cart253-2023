Hi Stephen & Lindy! 

Hope all is well :) 

As mentioned in the e-mail, I was on sick leave last week (week of September 25th) due to a medical issue. Big apologies, I was not able to deliver the exercice on the due date! 

Please find the dodge-em exercice as follow:

Let me know if anything is missing smile
Thank you,
