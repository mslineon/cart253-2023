# Template p5 project

Phase 1:

Assets needed

General idea

	1. My dog catching 
	2. Bones
	3. Users throw the ball // Removing
	4. Wearing glass when wins when dogs catch bones // not doing this one - instead bone appear in abi mouth
     
	
Interactivity

	• Ball throwing: // REMOVING THIS OPTION OF THROWING BALL.    
        -  Click, drag & release - get distance in-between mouse press & release using the dist function 

    • Bones falls from the hands when space buttons is clicked
        - hand is image 
        - hand moves on x axis with noise

    • Timer to catch 3 of each balls/bones
        - number that counts down using variable

    • Display an amount of bones/ball caught // decided to not do this one 
        - create variables of the amount of bones (amountOfBones)
        - create variables of the amount of balls (amountOfBalls)
        - everytime Abi & ball or bones touches, then the number of bones/balls is counted

    • Abi
        - walk straight back & forth on the x axis
        - variable to see the intersect abi & ball
        - variable to see the intersect abi & bones

    • States:

        - Title screen
        - Explain controls 
        - Simulation
        - Failure
            - 1, 2, 3 bone
            - 1, 2, 3 ball
            - enough bones and balls


2 movings parts 
	• controlled by the users
	• Maybe object are floating around?

	
Simulation:

	• Moving bones
	• Users Throwing balls
	• Dog touches bones = Happy Abi
	• Dog touches balls = Happy Abi
	• Dog missed = sad
