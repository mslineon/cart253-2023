This project simulation is a about with Abigail(my dog). Help her catch the bone. The user is the hand dropping a bone for Abigail to catch.

Image of abigail AKA doggie-babyyyy is a photoshoot I took of her, and where I remove the background. *Disclaimer, no dog has been harmed in the process. Many treats has been given for compensation. 

It is impossible to win the Game. You always end up being a bad mom. This is the idea/fear of always feeling like it's never enough no matter how hard I try to be good to a dog "dependant" to you, no matter what I do. I end up feeling no being a good enough mom for my dog.
