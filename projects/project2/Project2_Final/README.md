# Final Project - Mimosa Plant  

As we might imagine, fragility can be perceived as having a negative connotation. The concept here is to explore the subject with sensitivity. What does fragility mean in this context? How can we express fragility? Is it inherently bad or good? One can view it as a powerful aesthetic, while another might perceive it as weakness. Another may glorify it, considering it a quality to embrace within each individual. Could this contrast societal expectations for humans to be “strong”? As it might be in opposition to resilience, can fragility coexist with its opposite? Nevertheless, can we find beauty in this fragility? These questions leave it up to the viewers to interpret the significance and meaning of fragility.

The main idea here is to represent fragility in a way that prompts questioning. What if we show fragility as a means of self-protection? The perception of it with that knowledge can be miscommunicated and misinterpreted as fragility but rather as a defense mechanism against the environment.

Therefore, I would like to present fragility as an open-ended question through the visual representation of the Mimosa Pudica plant. This plant features sensitive compound leaves that fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, only to re-open a few minutes later.

On this piece, the user will be interacting with the plant displayed on the screen. The webcam camera is tracking the hand movement, more precisely the distance in-between the pointer & thumbs which influence the folding & unfolding of the plant pushing to an interaction from the users to this plants environment. 

In a technical way, the codes used a machine learning library called Ml5js, which is specifically a Machine Learning algorithm designed for P5js. This library offered references & examples of tracking with the handpose. This really helps the process in terms of tracking the hands, aka also declaring a landmark for the pointer & thumbs in order to calculate the distance in-between so that we cam make it interact with the plants. Technically, I feel very happy to have use the resources around me in order to make an idea happens. Artistically, fragility as a concept is something I desired to showcase in a interactive sense.
